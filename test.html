                Being a travel agency is something that, naturally, comes with a lot of questions. Here are a few of our
                most commonly asked questions about working with a travel agency. We're here to set your mind at ease,
                if you don't see your question here, send us an email, we love to talk to you!

                <p class="question-one">
                    How do travel agencies get paid? will I be charged extra or will my accommodations have an extra
                    fee?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are paid by the resorts, we do not charge a service fee.

                    Many resorts have price parity, the cost is same whether you book through us, direct with the
                    resort, or with an online booking engine.

                    The difference between using a travel agent is that we help you plan a stress-free vacation without
                    the hassle of going it alone.

                <p class="question-one">
                    Why should I book with you instead of an online booking site, or direct with a resort?
                </p>
                <p>
                    With us, you get exceptional personal assistance before, during, and after your vacation.

                    Budget is important and we strive to get your dream vacation within the budget you've set for it.
                    There's no pressure to go above and beyond what you're comfortable with. You can't enjoy your
                    vacation when you're stressed out about paying for it.

                    We provide honest advice about all resorts and destinations to help you choose the perfect resort
                    for you.

                    You also benefit from our extensive personal connections which carry a certain gravitas when needing
                    anything addressed. We have an easier time getting you perks (like getting your room upgraded)—it's
                    easier for us to get a "yes" because we work with them often.

                    We also arm you with your own personal +23408 call number to call and reach us if you need something
                    while you're away. You won't get that from a travel site.

                </p>
                <p>
                    No. We have access to all the same pricing for resorts as the online booking sites do and we can
                    price-match online booking engine pricing when comparing apples to apples.

                    In many cases, we can find discounts and other promotional offerings that are not offered to the
                    general public.
